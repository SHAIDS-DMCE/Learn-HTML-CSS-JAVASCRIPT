# INTRODUCTION TO HTML

<b>HTML is the standard markup language </b>. <br>
Which creates a skeleton for a basic website.<br>
<b>HTML is a case sensitive language</b>, thus one must be careful with the caps because it may throw errors <br>
If we open any website on browser it must have a HTML file.<br>
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document is an HTML5 doc. <br>
The <html> element is the root element of web page. <br>
The <head> element contains meta information about the web page .<br>
The <title> element gives a title to the web page .<br>
The <body> element defines the body of that document , and is a container for all the visible contents .<br>


# A standard HTML document must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>:-

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My Heading</h1>
<p>My Paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
  Headings in HTML are defined with the h1-h6 tags.<br>
  h1 denotes most important heading.<br>
  h6 denotes least important heading.<br>
  # "h1-h6" Header Tags:-
  
  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>This is <b>h1</b> heading </h1>
<h2>This is <b>h2</b> heading </h2>
<h3>This is <b>h3</b> heading </h3>
<h4>This is <b>h4</b> heading </h4>
<h5>This is <b>h5</b> heading </h5>
<h6>This is <b>h6</b> heading </h6>

</body>
</html>
```
  
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
Every paragraph starts on a new line, also the browser automatically adds some white space before and after a paragraph.
